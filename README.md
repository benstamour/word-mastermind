# Word Mastermind Game

This repository features code for a game of Word Mastermind. The goal of the player is to guess the computer's secret four-letter word. Each turn, they must guess a valid word, and they will receive feedback in the form of two numbers: one being the number of letters in their guess that are in the wrong place in the secret word, and the second being the number of letters in their guess that are in the correct place in the word. The player can enter their word using either their keyboard or the buttons on-screen, and they can also change the theme/colour scheme of the page. This project was built using Vue.js, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and Bootstrap.

Here is a sample screenshot of a completed game:
